It says nothing explicitly about the mysteries of Jesus' hidden or public life, but the articles of faith concerning his Incarnation and Passover do shed light on the whole of his earthly life. \"All that Jesus did and taught, from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven\", 171 is to be seen in the light of the mysteries of Christmas and Easter. \n",
